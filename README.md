# rust_aads - Rust Algorithms And Data Structures

rust_aads is an open repository with algorithms and data structures, used in computer science and 
competitive programming, written with Rust.

`lib.rs` file contains tests for structures and algorithms and data structures are divided into 
their own files. Please, message me / do PR if there is a better way to do this.

# Currently implemented Data Structures
* [Segment Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segment_tree) - `SegmentTree` struct in `segtree.rs`

# Currently implemented Algorithms
* [Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) - `bubble_sort` function in `sortings.
  rs`
* [Selection Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort) - `selection_sort` function in 
  `sortings.rs`
* [Insertion Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort) - `insertion_sort` function in 
  `sortings.rs`
